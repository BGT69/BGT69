- 👋 Hi, I’m @BGT69
- 👀 I’m interested in PHP based systems for small businesses and writing programming tools.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Making Tax Digital (MTD) system, using PHP, to interface with the UK HMRC. I can't believe that this has not been done already.
- 📫 How to reach me ... a good question.
